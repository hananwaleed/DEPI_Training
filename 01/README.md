## ðŸŽ¯ Task 1: Mathematical Operations Calculator

**ðŸ“‹ Description:**  
A program that takes two integer values and calculates:
- Sum
- Difference
- Product
- Integer division
- Remainder

**ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts:**  
Arithmetic operators, string interpolation, understanding `/` vs `~/`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task 2: Age Classifier (Adult or Minor)

**ðŸ“‹ Description:**  
A program that checks if a person is an adult based on their age and prints either "Adult" or "Minor" accordingly.

**ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts:**  
Ternary operator, conditional logic, and formatted output.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Task 3: Runtime Type Checker

**ðŸ“‹ Description:**  
A simple check to verify if a variable is of type `int` using Dartâ€™s `is` operator.

**ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts:**  
Type checking, boolean evaluation, runtime type analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task 4: Negative Type Validator

**ðŸ“‹ Description:**  
A program that ensures a given variable is **not** a `String`, using Dartâ€™s `is!` operator.

**ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts:**  
Negative type validation, complementary checking, boolean logic.
