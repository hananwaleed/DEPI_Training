#  Drag & Drop 

This Flutter project demonstrates how to use **drag-and-drop interactions** with colorful draggable circles and a drop target box that smoothly changes color.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ `ColorDraggable` Widget
- **Type:** `StatelessWidget`  
- Represents a reusable circle that can be dragged.  
Built with `Draggable<Color>`:
  - **child** â†’ The normal circle view.  
  - **feedback** â†’ The widget shown while dragging.  
  - **childWhenDragging** â†’ The widget that stays in place (faded) while the circle is being dragged.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ `DragTarget`
- Represents the drop area (the box).  
- **onAccept** â†’ Updates the box color to the dropped circleâ€™s color.  
- Uses **AnimatedContainer** for smooth color transitions.

## ðŸ§© Core Widgets

### ðŸ”¹ `Draggable`
The draggable item (in this case, the colored circle).  
- **child** â†’ The widget that appears normally.  
- **feedback** â†’ The widget shown when dragging (moves with your finger).  
- **childWhenDragging** â†’ The widget left behind when the item is being dragged.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ `DragTarget`
The widget that can receive dragged items.  
- **onAccept** â†’ Triggered when an item is dropped.  
- **onWillAccept** â†’ Decides whether the target should accept the dragged item or not.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ `LongPressDraggable`
Almost the same as `Draggable`, but dragging only starts **after a long press**.
