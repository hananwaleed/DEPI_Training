## ✨ Fundamentals Object-Oriented Learning

Over the past few exercises, I focused on strengthening my understanding of Dart fundamentals through hands-on practice with variables, null safety, and class-based programming. These sessions helped me write safer, more organized code while building a solid foundation for app development in Dart.

### ✅ What I Practiced

🧠 **Core Concepts**
- Declaring and using Dart’s basic data types such as `String`, `int`, `double`, `bool`, `List`, and `Map`.
- Understanding and applying null safety using the `??` operator and conditional checks to avoid runtime errors.

🛠️ **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Creating custom classes with both required and optional properties.
- Writing constructors for clean and flexible object creation.
- Implementing methods inside classes to print or process object data.
- Practicing how to create and interact with multiple instances (objects).

💬 **Nullable Fields**
- Explored how to safely work with fields that may or may not have a value (`double?`, `String?`).
- Applied conditional logic to prevent null-related issues and ensure graceful outputs.

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Dart’s null safety makes it easier to write robust code, especially when working with optional values.
- Classes are powerful tools for structuring data and behaviors in a readable and reusable way.
- Using constructors and methods adds clarity and modularity to programs.
- Repetition and small projects are great ways to deeply understand syntax and language behavior.
