## âœ¨Functions & Parameters

During this session, I focused on understanding how functions work in Dart and how to write clean, reusable logic using both traditional and arrow syntax. I explored how to pass data into functions using required and optional parameters, and how to make decisions inside functions using conditionals.

---

### âœ… Function Syntax & Usage

- Practiced defining functions with return types like `int`, `double`, and `bool`.
- Explored arrow functions for writing concise single-line logic.
- Gained confidence using both positional and named parameters.

### ðŸ§  Concepts Explored

#### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Arithmetic Functions**
- Wrote functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
- Handled division by zero using a simple `if` statement.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Arrow Syntax**
- Used the `=>` operator to write functions like `doubleValue` and `isEven` in a cleaner way.
- Realized how helpful arrow syntax is for quick utility functions.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Named Parameters with Defaults**
- Learned how to define named parameters and mark them as `required`.
- Created functions like `sendMessage` that behave differently based on optional flags.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Function Quiz & Syntax Check**
- Reviewed valid function declaration syntax in Dart.
- Strengthened my understanding of Dartâ€™s structure and style.

### ðŸ§ª Sample Outputs

- âœ… Calculated area of a rectangle using named parameters.
- âœ… Doubled a value using arrow syntax.
- âœ… Checked if numbers are even or odd.
- âœ… Sent both normal and urgent messages.
- âœ… Printed personalized greeting messages.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Functions make code reusable, clean, and more readable.
- Arrow syntax is perfect for short logic-based functions.
- Named parameters help in writing flexible functions that are easier to call and read.
- Proper parameter validation (like checking for zero in division) improves code safety.
