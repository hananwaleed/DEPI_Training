## üìö Conditions & Loops

During this session, I focused on mastering the core concepts of conditional statements and looping structures in Dart. I practiced writing clean and efficient logic using different control flow tools. Here's what I explored:

---

### ‚úÖ Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)

- Learned how to evaluate conditions to make decisions in code.
- Built grading logic to determine performance level (`Excellent`, `Good`, etc.).
- Checked whether a number is positive or if a student passed based on a threshold.
- Practiced combining multiple conditions to reflect real-life logic.

### üîÅ Loops Overview (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for-in`, `forEach`)

- Used `for` loops for simple counting tasks.
- Applied `while` loops to repeat logic based on a condition.
- Understood how `do-while` ensures the block runs at least once before checking the condition.
- Practiced iterating over lists with both `for-in` and `forEach` to print or manipulate list items.

### üí° Key Takeaways

- The `switch` statement is a clean alternative to `if-else` when checking multiple fixed values.
- The difference between `while` and `do-while` helped me understand execution flow better.
- Working with lists and loops boosted my confidence in handling collections.
- Practicing different loop types made me aware of which one fits best for each task.
